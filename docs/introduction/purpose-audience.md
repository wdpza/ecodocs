This repository allows faculty members to upload and organize media resources such as images, videos, and audio files. These resources can be accessed by other faculty members, allowing for collaboration and knowledge sharing within the field of Economics.

In addition to the media repository, econom.co.za also includes a glossary of terms related to Economics.

It is a useful tool for students who are just beginning their studies in Economics, as well as for those who are looking to refresh their understanding of key concepts.

While the media repository is primarily intended for use by University faculty, the glossary is available to anyone interested in Economics. Currently, students do not have access to the media repository, but they can benefit from the glossary as a valuable resource for their studies.

Overall, the purpose of econom.co.za is to provide a centralized platform for Economics faculty members to share and access media resources, as well as to provide a useful tool for students to access and learn key concepts in Economics.
